## Files Included

### Primary Scripts

#### 1. APPLY_HEALTH_OPTIMIZATION.ps1
The main health optimization engine that:
- **Calculates overall health score** (0-100) based on:
  - CPU Health (25%)
  - Memory Health (25%)
  - Disk Health (25%)
  - Services Health (25%)

- **Detects critical issues**:
  - Services not running
  - Disk space critically low
  - Security vulnerabilities

- **Identifies warning signs**:
  - High CPU usage (>70%)
  - High memory usage (>80%)
  - Fragmentation issues

- **Implements optimizations**:
  - Clears temporary files
  - Optimizes startup programs
  - Ensures Windows Update running
  - Verifies safe parameters

- **Identifies bottlenecks**:
  - CPU Performance
  - Memory Constraints
  - Disk I/O

- **Creates action items**:
  - Tracks tasks with priorities
  - Schedules follow-ups
  - Assigns owners

- **Generates detailed HTML reports** with all findings

**Usage:**
```powershell
# Dry-run mode (preview changes without applying)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "APPLY_HEALTH_OPTIMIZATION.ps1" -DryRun

# Production mode (applies optimizations)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "APPLY_HEALTH_OPTIMIZATION.ps1"
```

- System health score
- Any issues detected
- Optimizations applied
- Recommended actions

### Step 3: Set Up Automation (Optional)
```bash
# Method 1: Use the batch file (Easiest)
1. Right-click SETUP_AUTOMATION.bat
2. Select "Run as administrator"
3. Follow prompts

# Method 2: Use PowerShell (Advanced)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "SETUP_TASK_SCHEDULER.ps1" -Schedule Weekly -Time 02:00
```

### Step 4: Verify Scheduled Task
```bash
# Open Task Scheduler
taskschd.msc

## Health Score Explained

### Score Range
- **90-100**: Excellent - System in optimal condition
- **75-89**: Good - System healthy with minor issues
- **60-74**: Fair - System requires attention
- **45-59**: Poor - System needs significant optimization
- **0-44**: Critical - System requires immediate intervention

### Component Breakdown
Each component is scored 0-25:
- **CPU Health**: Low utilization is better (< 80% target)
- **Memory Health**: Low utilization is better (< 85% target)
- **Disk Health**: Adequate free space is better (< 90% full target)
- **Services Health**: Fewer failed services is better

   - Track trends over time
   - Act on critical issues promptly

3. **Keep Records**
   - Archive old reports
   - Maintain audit trail
   - Document manual interventions

4. **Test Before Production**
   - Always run in dry-run mode first
   - Review changes before full deployment
   - Verify system stability

5. **Maintain Documentation**
   - Document custom modifications
   - Keep baseline metrics
   - Track optimization history

---

## System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016+
- **Privileges**: Administrator (for optimization and scheduling)
- **PowerShell**: 5.0 or higher
