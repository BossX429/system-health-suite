## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING COMPLETED

### Issue 1: PowerShell Tokenizer Parse Error ✅ RESOLVED
**Symptom:** "The '<' operator is reserved for future use"
**Root Cause:** PowerShell tokenizer interprets `<` at parse-time
**Solution:** Character code encoding `[char]60` for `<`, `[char]62` for `>`
**Outcome:** Script now loads without parser errors

### Issue 2: File Corruption from Tool Errors ✅ RESOLVED
**Symptom:** Files corrupted with mixed/duplicate content
**Root Cause:** `create_file` tool prepending old content
**Solution:** Used `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText()` via .NET API
**Outcome:** Clean files created, no corruption

### Issue 3: Parameter Name Error ✅ RESOLVED
**Symptom:** "Cannot find parameter 'Path'" in Out-File
**Root Cause:** Incorrect parameter name
**Solution:** Changed `-Path` to `-FilePath`
**Outcome:** Reports now generate successfully
